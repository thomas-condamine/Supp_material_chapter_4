Bilaterian genes contain two promoters (upstream from exons 1a and 1b). MATEs (exons bearing a similar colour within a gene), have not been found outside of Bilateria, and have been lost in C. intestinalis and H. robusta (green boxes). In both vertebrates and the medusa of P. carnea, specific TPM forms are associated with striated muscle (orange boxes). Data is lacking for stauro-, cubo- and scyphozoans, as well as for ctenophores and sponges (bold red font). pA = polyAdenylation site. Full species names are given in Table 1.
